Hi, I’m Carlyle, interested in pretty much everything that involves tech and science,
specially scientific programming and astronomy. My background is electrical engineering
and computer science, in particular large system integration projects.

It's been a while since my last line of code so, now that I'm retired, I'm re-learning
VB, C, C++ and will progress (hopefully) to HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Java, C#, etc, etc, etc...
I'm sure that there will be no lack of things to learn. Not counting the distractions: I just
noticed the existence of WSL2 so I got to to stop and give it a try, check on how LUnix is doing.

On the spare time I'l continue with Italian (Duolingo), cycling, science fiction and dark fantasy.
