Hi, I’m Carlyle, interested in pretty much everything that involves tech and science,
specially scientific programming and astronomy. My background is electrical engineering
and computer science, in particular large system integration projects.

As I'm retired, I can learn (re-learn) how to develop software with current technologies: 
modern IDE, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Android, etc, etc, etc...
There are no lack of things to learn. 

On the spare time I'll continue with cycling, reading science fiction and dark fantasy,
and will start swimming in 2024.
